FamFamFam.com provides the excellent set of Silk icons.

Our clients like these icons and also want a few customizations:

  * enhance contrast and sharpness for better visibility
  * use web safe colors to work well with older systems
  * create custom icons for checkbox actions
  * create custom icons for a rating system of 1 to 5
  * change files from .png to .gif to work better with IE 6

We customized the Silk icons via these Photoshop commands:

  * Image > Mode > RGB
  * Image > Adjustments > Levels: 30 0.70 255
  * Filter > Sharpen > Sharpen Edges
  * File > Save For Web > Gif + Adaptive

We created custom icons in the same style for checkbox actions:

  * checkbox_select_all.gif
  * checkbox_select_none.gif

We created custom icons for a rating system of 1 to 5,
by copying five flag icons to files with these names:

  * flag1.gif is a copy of flag_blue.gif
  * flag2.gif is a copy of flag_green.gif
  * flag3.gif is a copy of flag_yellow.gif
  * flag4.gif is a copy of flag_orange.gif
  * flag5.gif is a copy of flag_red.gif
